    <h1>Happy Birthday Tanu</h1>
    <p>
      When we first met, I never thought that we would get so far and last so
      long in each otherâ€™s life. I thought that you will be just like another
      passing by person in my life, very few people can tolerate my drama and
      hyper activism, that is why I consider you as my person and if you have
      lasted for so long then I think you can keep up with me for a few more
      years. I know it has not been that long(only 4 months) but for some reason I feel like I have known you for a really long long time

    <p>I like your lame  and stupid jokes</p>
    <p>I like your love for combining words </p> 
    <p>I like your company, just your presence around me feels nice</p> 
    <p>I like how you look into my eyes when I talk to you</p> 
    <p>I like your hugs so much that sometimes when I am in your arms I want the time to freeze, the world to stop and it should be just us</p> 
    <p>I like how you co-ordinate with my drama</p>
    <p>I like your taste in music </p>
    <p>I like the kind of person that you are</p>
